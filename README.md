# ComputerVisionFinal
All files included are just ones that I've modified. 
Replaced the deprecated libraries so that the cells run and created the modified model architecture, (which is working) just havent trained anything yet.
All that remains is being able to run the training portion so that we can train the original and the modified and compare the results.
